üìã Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting human activities (e.g., walking, sitting, standing, laying) by analyzing time-series data collected from smartphone sensors. The data, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, includes gyroscopic and accelerometric readings from 30 volunteers performing six activities. The objective is to classify activities accurately using predictive models to demonstrate the potential of sensor-based human activity recognition.
